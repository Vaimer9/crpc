A Blazingly Fast Rich Presence Command Line Application made in rust


### JSON Example
```json
{
	"id": "",
	"status": "",
	"details": "",
	"large": true,
	"small": false,
	"want_buttons": false,
	"button_numbers": 1,
	"large_image": "",
	"small_image": "",
	"large_tool": "",
	"small_tool": "",
	"buttons": ["", "", "", ""]
}
```
I have tried my best to keep the JSON as simple as possible.
